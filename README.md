# Sprint 1: TypeScript CSV

### Task C: Proposing Enhancement

- #### Step 1: Brainstorm on your own.

- #### Step 2: Use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

- #### Step 3: use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

    Include a list of the top 4 enhancements or edge cases you think are most valuable to explore in the next week’s sprint. Label them clearly by category (extensibility vs. functionality), and include whether they came from you, the LLM, or both. Describe these using the User Story format—see below for a definition. 

    Functionality: 
   - I wanted parser to handle quoted fields with embedded commas, newlines, and escaped quotes so that it can parse any valid CSV file.
   (Used personal thoughts + LLM to expand)
   - Wanted parser to also detect and report inconsistent column counts across rows to catch bad data early and avoid errors. 
   (Used personal thoughts + LLM to expand)

   Extensibility
   - Want to be able to specify custom validation schemas for each row as a developer so that I can enforce business logic and data integrity and secruity when parsing.
   (Used personal thoughts)
    - I also want parser to provide detailed error information, including row number and error type, so that I can imporve my efficiency and quickly identify and resole whatever issue needed.
   (Used personal thoughts)


    Include your notes from above: what were your initial ideas, what did the LLM suggest, and how did the results differ by prompt? What resonated with you, and what didn’t? (3-5 sentences.) 

    My initial ideas surrounded efficiency and really more surorunding the extesnisiblity. The LLM really helped me flesh out some of my ideas for the functionality part. While I initially focused on aspects such as robust parsinf and validation, the LLM gave some more very specific and niche responses such as "delimeter flexibility" and "header mapping". Which these didn't make as much sense the other ideas surrounding embedded commas and etc. helped me think of new aspects.
